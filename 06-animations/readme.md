# Three.js Journey

In this lesson we learned about the movement objects behavior.
Use the function clock from THREE.js library to calculate time delta time.
Import elapsed time to calculate time delta time.
we used the gsap library to transform the position of the objects like an alternative to the ordinary process with three.js importing more resources.
