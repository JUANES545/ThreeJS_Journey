# Three.js Journey
In this lesson we learned about the cameras, cameras arrays, position, functions and important values and properties like:
- Recommended camera field of view: 45-75.
- Orbit controls configuration (read the documentation for orbit)
- First person camera.trace.
- A lot of preconfigured cameras to use.
- Detect the cursor over the page and modify the position of the main camera
